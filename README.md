# RFID Based Automated Milk Dispensing System

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is an *RFID-based milk dispensing system* that automatically dispenses different quantities of milk based on the RFID card scanned.  
It is built using *Arduino, **RFID reader, **IR sensor, **LCD display, and **motor pump control*.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
- Detects and reads RFID cards to identify the user.
- Dispenses *predefined quantities* of milk (100ml, 200ml, 500ml, 1 litre).
- Displays status and instructions on an *I2C LCD*.
- IR sensor detects the presence of a container before dispensing.
- *LED & buzzer* feedback for user interaction.
- Fully automated process with motor control.

## âš™ Working Process

1. *Initialization*  
   - When powered ON, the LCD displays "Welcome!".
   - All LEDs and buzzer are set to default (OFF).

2. *Card Scanning*  
   - The user scans their *RFID card*.
   - The Arduino reads the *card UID* and matches it to a pre-registered card.

3. *Quantity Selection via RFID Card*  
   - *Card A* â†’ Dispenses *100ml*
   - *Card B* â†’ Dispenses *200ml*
   - *Card C* â†’ Dispenses *500ml*
   - *Card D* â†’ Dispenses *1 litre*

4. *Container Detection*  
   - IR sensor checks for a container.
   - If *no container* is detected â†’ LCD shows "Place Container", buzzer turns ON.
   - If container is detected â†’ proceeds to milk dispensing.

5. *Milk Dispensing*  
   - Green LED turns ON.
   - Motor runs for a specific time depending on quantity.
   - LCD displays "Milk Dispensing" and quantity.

6. *Completion*  
   - Motor stops after required time.
   - LCD shows "Thank You".
   - System resets for the next user.
