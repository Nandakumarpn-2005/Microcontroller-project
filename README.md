RFID-Based Automatic Milk Dispensing System

This project is an *Arduino-based automated milk dispensing system* that uses *RFID cards* to dispense pre-set quantities of milk.  
It includes an *IR sensor, **LCD display, **LED indicators, and a **buzzer* for user feedback.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- *RFID Authentication* â€“ Only registered RFID cards can trigger dispensing.
- *Predefined Milk Quantities* â€“ Different cards dispense different amounts:
  - Card A â†’ 100 ml  
  - Card B â†’ 200 ml  
  - Card C â†’ 500 ml  
  - Card D â†’ 1 liter  
- *IR Sensor Safety* â€“ Ensures a container is placed before dispensing.
- *LCD Display* â€“ Shows instructions and dispensing status.
- *LED & Buzzer Alerts* â€“ Indicate errors, readiness, and completion.
